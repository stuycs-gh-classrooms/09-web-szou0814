<span class="italic">Hamilton: An American Musical</span> is a biographical musical inspired by the biography <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758" class="textlink"><span class="italic">Alexander Hamilton</span></a> by Ron Chernow. The musical was created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical's playright, composer, and lyricist. After being composed for over 7 years, from 2008 to 2015, the musical finally premiered Off-Broadway on January 20, 2015 at The Public Theater in New York. Since its premiere, it has received numerous Tony, Grammy, Laurence Olivier, and Pulitzer Prize awards. It is now considered Broadway's most popular and second best selling show.

The soundtrack, drawing heavily from musical genres hip-hop, R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes, narrates the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton. It begins with an introduction to Hamilton's immigrant, impoverished, and disadvantaged background and his arrival in New York. It details his involvement in the American Revolution, his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler, and his career as a lawyer and Secretary of the Treasury and ends with his death by duel with Aaron Burr.

<span class="italic">Hamilton</span> consists of two separate acts, both narrated by Aaron Burr. Act I focuses on Alexander Hamilton's struggle to rise above his background and status through the revolution as George Washington's main aide-de-camp. With his arrival in New York, Hamilton first meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan. The five men quickly become close friends with their similar goals in the revolution and the abolition of slavery. Hamilton then meets and enchants Elizabeth Schuyler, second daughter of wealthy Philip Schuyler, and gains the support and backing of her family. Through his achievements and efforts in the revolution, he rises to the position of Washington's right-hand man. Washington, being fond of Hamilton while considering Elizabeth's worries, is initially reserved about granting Hamilton command of a battalion. His reservations eventually lead to Hamilton's resignation. However, at the final Battle of Yorktown, Hamilton returns and, together with Marquis de Lafayette, secures victory and independence. Act II focuses on Alexander Hamilton's struggle to maintain his reputation and gain approval for his financial plan after the war. In this act, Aaron Burr's narration starts to become untrustworthy as his relationship with Hamilton begins to worsen. While both are orphans with a desire for power, Hamilton, from an impoverished background, always takes his shot---he openly shares his opinion without restraint and is willing to take risks---while Burr, from a more privileged and wealthy background, waits for it---he prefers to observe and protect himself and his reputation rather than take action. As Hamilton quickly rises in power and popularity as he engages in political battles with Thomas Jefferson, Burr begins to become envious and have a desire for action. Burr's political power begins to grow and he reaches his peak as he goes against Thomas Jefferson for the presidential position. Burr, initially sure of his victory, loses as Hamilton endorses Jefferson, Hamilton's political enemy, instead of him. He challenges Hamilton to a duel, where Burr takes his shot while Hamilton, pointing his gun towards the sky, waits for it.

The musical wonderfully explores the theme of desire to rise above one's background and station in life and the complexity of establishing one's legacy.
