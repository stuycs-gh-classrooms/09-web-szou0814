<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
<i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i> is a biographical musical inspired by the biography <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758"><i>Alexander Hamilton</i></a> by Ron Chernow. The musical was created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical's playright, composer, and lyricist. After being composed for over 7 years, from 2008 to 2015, the musical finally premiered Off-Broadway on January 20, 2015 at The Public Theater in New York. Since its premiere, it has received numerous Tony, Grammy, Laurence Olivier, and Pulitzer Prize awards. It is now considered Broadway's most popular and second best selling show.

<p>
<i>Hamilton</i> consists of two separate acts, with a 15-minute intermission in between. The soundtrack, drawing heavily from musical genres hip-hop, R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes, narrates the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton. It begins with an introduction to Hamilton's immigrant, impoverished, and disadvantaged background and his arrival in New York. It details his involvement in the American Revolution, his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler, and his career as a lawyer and Secretary of the Treasury and ends with his death by duel with Aaron Burr.
